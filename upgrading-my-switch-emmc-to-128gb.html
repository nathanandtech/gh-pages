This means as long as I never go online (delete all the wifi connections), I can always just switch the EMMC back in and it will be as if I never ran any CFW.<br>After using Paul's modified restore tool with the backup size check removed, I had the Switch booting back up perfectly with the bigger EMMC, however the switch wouldn't see the new size until I extended the size of the partition, but inside the encryption. This was very tricky to do, and I didn't find either of the above links to be entirely complete as to how it was done.<br><br>I eventually managed to get it booting, and so had a 128GB switch booting and working perfectly!<br>As soon as it was working and booting I had a check online and found a Samsung SDINBDA4-256G 256GB module for sale.<br>https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?id=582577399024&amp;_u=u20k5lp0e05b<br><br>I ordered one, and kept testing the 128gb whilst I waited for the shipping to me, then sent it off to the same company to get it soldered by someone a bit more experienced.<br><br>For now, 128gb Switch success!</p><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://nathanbunn.com/media/posts/3/128gbdone.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://nathanbunn.com/media/posts/3/responsive/128gbdone-xs.jpg 300w, https://nathanbunn.com/media/posts/3/responsive/128gbdone-sm.jpg 480w, https://nathanbunn.com/media/posts/3/responsive/128gbdone-md.jpg 768w, https://nathanbunn.com/media/posts/3/responsive/128gbdone-lg.jpg 1024w, https://nathanbunn.com/media/posts/3/responsive/128gbdone-xl.jpg 1360w, https://nathanbunn.com/media/posts/3/responsive/128gbdone-2xl.jpg 1600w" height="3120" width="4160" alt=""></figure></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on July 19, 2020</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://nathanbunn.com/authors/nathan/" class="invert" rel="author">Nathan</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://nathanbunn.com/switch-to-256.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Switch to 256 </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://nathanbunn.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-01-31T18:57" class="feed__date">January 31, 2019</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://nathanbunn.com/nintendo-switch-emmc-nand-upgrade-guide.html" class="invert">Nintendo Switch EMMC nand upgrade guide</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2019-01-30T18:54" class="feed__date">January 30, 2019</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://nathanbunn.com/switch-to-256.html" class="invert">Switch to 256</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii Static CMS</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://nathanbunn.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
